# Classic Snake Game

A simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses the canvas API to draw the board and features a growing snake, a score system, and a restart button.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay: The snake grows and the score increases as it eats red apples.
- Collision detection: The game ends if the snake hits the edges of the board.
- Restart functionality: Press the restart button to reset the game and play again.
- Canvas-based rendering: The board and snake are drawn using the `getContext` method of the HTML canvas element.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the snake.
2. Eat the red apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid crashing into the edges of the board.
4. If you lose, press the **Restart** button to start a new game.
